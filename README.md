## About the project 

Being a pet owner , I understand the fear of our pets getting lost in the city. The taunting inquisitiveness of our animals tends to keep giving us these nightmares of loosing it . 

This project specifically helps us create a prediction model that helps us pin point the possible places our pet could be wandering about in . In many cases , based on the data , we have observed that the animal is usually around the vicinity . The major trouble occurs when a shelter comes across a stray and adopts it , the owner doesnâ€™t usually know which shelter to approach for their animal . 

## Code 
### Libaries used : skitlearn , numpy , pandas , seaborn, matplotlib
### Coded in Jyupter Notebook 

Our code runs through each available feature in our data set and try and understand the dependencies of them across the data. 
We plotted the features and preprocessed the data to clear out any anomalies in the data. 

Our next step was to divide the data set into training and testing set to scale the data. We applied prediction models and plotted the out puts to the predicted values to understand the accuracy of the model. 

We mapped out the locations and predictions on a map using folium.map 

## Future Scope 

The best prediction model based on error can be saved and fed back into a web page to help create an application for prediction of the location of your pet from previous data .
